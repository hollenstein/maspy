Bug fixes, performance, code design, documentation, ...
-------------------------------------------------------
- Implementation of multi processing for certain bottleneck tasks.

  - generate siContainerFiles
  - in silico digest (split proteins into batches, then add results to proteindb)
  - rt alignment (one specfile pair per process)
  - recalibration of mz (one process per specfile)

Core
----
- splitContainer -> returns a list of containers or a dict
- extractContainer -> returns one container of one or multiple specfiles

General concepts
----------------
- allow methods manipulating data (eg. psm to feature matching, rt alignment, ...) should return
  a report object, this report object can then be used to plot / print / write file report of the procedure

Peptide features
----------------
- Retention time alignment: return an object that allows subsequent correction of the retention time
- Feature grouping: conflicting features for one specfile position still not solved
  -> Introduce some statistical measurement for rt, m/z deviation cut off
- Correct the MH dependent m/z error of features generated by openMS feature finder centroided
- Add calcMz attribute to annotated features (depending on best peptide identification of course)

Peptide feature groups
----------------------
- Label state predictor -> retention time shifts

Protein database
----------------
- importProteinDatabase -> provide a function, where a protein attribute can be specified and a new dictionary is generated,
  linking this attribute, preferably the protein name, to the protein entry
- Rework peptide entities (currently not so important)
- Save and load protein database from an in silico digested fasta file (specify number of missed cleavages upon import)
- Generate decoy fasta files from target fasta files

Workflows
---------

Spectrum Identification Items
-----------------------------
- Add mzIdentlML as standard SII import format
- Rework importPsmResults():

  There should be a more general import function, that takes care of the storage of parsed psm results.
  General case of a spreadsheet like file, or more special cases as xml files.
  Specify header names (as written in the file), how these attributes should be named in the container and which data type they should get

  - Maybe also specify a function how to retrieve the scan nr from the "scan entry"

- Change modifications to unimod annotation, or add entries to a modification list.
- "Unimod" and other masses, remove all "dependencies" on the term UNIMOD
- Protein grouping (work in progress)

- Properly implement dipeptides (label descriptor, protein evidence)
  when generating psmList, group psm according to specfile, use Try: except statement... (can't remember what this means)
