Introduction
------------
Maspy is a Python library with the aim to provide simple, convenient and
versatile access to proteomics data of bottom up experiments. To achieve this
it features an internal data representation that facilitates comfortable use
of this data. Maspy is intended as a tool for researchers that allows the
combination of different software to generate customized and scriptable data
processing workflows and to enable interactive data analysis with Python.
