Introduction:
spectra are the most basic results produced by any mass spectrometry experiment
-> start of the tutorial / introduction

- what is mzML ?
    eg from pyteomics: mzML is an XML-based format for experimental data obtained on MS/MS or LC-MS setups.
    or from http://www.psidev.info/mzml: format for encoding raw spectrometer output
- how to convert vendor format files to mzML?
    - use msConvert from proteoWizard suite
    - also allows peak picking to obtain centroided data
- what exactly is the problem of mzML files?
    - modern mass spectrometers can generate tens of thousands spectra per hour
      resulting in huge mzML files because of spectral information
    - parsing takes a lot of time even tough sometimes only part of the data
      has to be accessed

Maspy implementation:
- maspy features an own internal representation of mzML files
    - contains all information present in the mzML file, split into four groups
    - run metadata, spectrum item metadata, spectrum array item, chromatogram item
    - explain all of them ...
    - explain what spectrum items are, and what their purpose is
- after conversion, each group is saved seperately and can therefore be imported individually
    - run metadata in xml, arrays as binary data, all other data as JSON
    - smaller file size
    - faster data access
- maspy allows writing a new mzML file from the msrunContainer (the internal mzMl represenation)
    - allows to modify mzML within maspy and pass the changed mzML file to external software
    - note: indexing not yet supported


The mzML format is an open, XML-based format for mass spectrometer output
files, developed with the full participation of vendors and researchers in
order to create a single open format that would be supported by all software.
