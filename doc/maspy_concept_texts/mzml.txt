Spectra data in MasPy basics
============================

Every vendor software produces result files containing spectra
information in a different proprietary format which may or may not be
documented. This hinders interoperability.

The mzML format is an open, XML-based format for mass spectrometer output
files, developed with the full participation of vendors and researchers in
order to create a single open format that would be supported by all software.

There are however drawbacks with respect to the mzML format, these drawbacks are x, y, z,
and masPy mitigates them in the following way.










Introduction:
spectra are the most basic results produced by any mass spectrometry experiment
-> start of the tutorial / introduction

- what is mzML ?
    eg from pyteomics: mzML is an XML-based format for experimental data obtained on MS/MS or LC-MS setups.
    or from http://www.psidev.info/mzml: format for encoding raw spectrometer output
- how to convert vendor format files to mzML?
    - use msConvert from proteoWizard suite
    - also allows peak picking to obtain centroided data

- what exactly is the problem of mzML files?
    - modern mass spectrometers can generate tens of thousands spectra per hour
      resulting in huge mzML files because of spectral information
    - parsing takes a lot of time even tough sometimes only part of the data
      has to be accessed

Maspy implementation:
- maspy features an own internal representation of mzML files
    - contains all information present in the mzML file, split into four groups
    - run metadata, spectrum item metadata, spectrum array item, chromatogram item
    - explain all of them ...
    - explain what spectrum items are, and what their purpose is
- after conversion, each group is saved seperately and can therefore be imported individually
    - run metadata in xml, arrays as binary data, all other data as JSON
    - smaller file size
    - faster data access
- maspy allows writing a new mzML file from the msrunContainer (the internal mzMl represenation)
    - allows to modify mzML within maspy and pass the changed mzML file to external software
    - note: indexing not yet supported

What is the difference between Profile and Centroid MS data?

MS data collected off an instrument is presented as either profile or
centroid mode. Shown below are two mass spectra illustrating an ion
cluster for profile data and a centroid mass spectrum created from the
profile data.

In profile mode, a peak is represented by a collection of signals over
several scans. The advantage of profile data is it is easier to
classify a signal as a true peak from noise off the instrument.

In centroid mode, the signals are displayed as discrete m/z with zero
line widths. The advantage of centroid data is the file size is
significantly smaller as there is less information describing a
signal.  --- ad peak picking ---

Use for archiving, sharing, and processing -> much easier for software development
